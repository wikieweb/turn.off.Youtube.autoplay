The YouTube autoplay feature automatically starts playing a new video after you finish watching the current video. Autoplayed videos are related to your viewing history and are help you discover more content. Here's how to turn off autoplay if you don't want new videos to begin playing on their own.

* Open YouTube.

* If you're not already signed into your Google account, select the blue Sign In link in the top right corner to enter your login details and sign in.

* Search for or select any video to go to its page and start watching it. You don't have to watch the whole thing and can select the pause button to pause it.

* Select the Autoplay is on button below the playhead (next to the Subtitles/closed captions button).
